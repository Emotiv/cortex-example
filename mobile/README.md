## EMOTIV App mobile
[What is EMOTIV App (for desktop)?](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-manual/)

EMOTIV App for mobile is required for any other apps which want to access EEG raw data and/or processed data from Emotiv headsets. You will need it to:
* log in Emotiv system
* manage headset connections
* manage 3rd app permissions
* It also provides a secure web socket connection (at wss://localhost:6868) for your app to read data from, make training actions, etc. See more details in [Cortex API Documentation](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/).

### Installing
##### Unreleased version (only for Emotiv-partner developers)

- For iOS You need to install [Testflight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) to be able download EMOTIV App to your device.
- You will receive an invitation email to a testing program for an unreleased version of the EMOTIV App.
	- *Note: this is only available for our partner developers, not for everyone.*
- You can click on the link provided in the email, follow the guide to install EMOTIV App on your Android device.
	- You cannot install if you have any version of EMOTIV App installed on your device, so make sure you uninstall it (for all users) before installing a new version.
	- If you send the link to others, they may not access to our unreleased version as long as they are not in our list.

##### Released version

Not available yet.

## Try EMOTIV App
- Open EMOTIV App, accept all permission requests. Make sure Bluetooth service & Location service are turned on, EMOTIV App needs these services to work with headsets.
- Log in using your Emotiv account. You are on the page of "Available Devices".
- Turn on your Emotiv headset, wait for the headset to show up.
	- *Note: If you don't see the headset after 30s, you can try to turn it off then on again.*
- After the headset is shown up on the list, click to connect.
	- After the headset is connected on EMOTIV App, you can access to this headset from your app using [queryHeadsets](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/headset/queryheadsets) API.
	- We support only one connected headset. You cannot connect more than one headset at the same time.
- You can navigate to other pages using the top left menu icon.
- If you see anything inconvenience, you can find `Send Feedback` in the menu.

## Try Cortex V2 Example
- Cortex V2 Example demonstrates how to work with Cortex API. To get started, you may want to look at the API documentation: https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/.
    - *Note: API documentation is only for desktop version but should be almost the same on mobile. Exceptions will be noted below.*
- Open project under `Android/CortexV2Example` by Android Studio or `iOS/CortexV2-Emotiv-iOS` by Xcode. You can see CortexV2Example is a set of modules, each module contains example code for a specific feature:

Module| Related Cortex APIs
----------------|----------------
cortexclient |[Connecting to the Cortex API](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/connecting-to-the-cortex-api)
authorize |[Authentication](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/authentication)
headset-session | [Headsets](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/headset) & [Sessions](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/session)
record-marker | [Record](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/records) & [Markers](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/markers)
eeg / motion / bandpower / facial-expression / mental-command / performance-metrics | [Data Subscription](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/data-subscription)
facial-expression-training / mental-command-training | [BCI](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/bci) & [Advanced BCI](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/advanced-bci)

- Before running example code, you need to replace values of `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` with your client id, client secret.

In `cortexclient/src/main/java/com/emotiv/cortexv2example/utils/Constant.java` with Android project

    public final static String CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id";
    public final static String CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret";

And `CortexV2-Emotiv-iOS/CortexV2-Emotiv-ObjC/CortexV2-Emotiv-ObjC/Config.m` with Objective C project

Or `CortexV2-Emotiv-iOS/CortexV2-Example-Swift/CortexV2-Example-Swift/Config.swift` with Swift project

If you want to run with a specific license. You also can change config in this file as well.

- Choose the module you want to build and run on mobile device. Make sure you accept all permission requests.
- The module app has a list of buttons demonstrating API calls. Try click on each button, you can see a pair of request/response json strings printed out in `Android Studio logcat` or `Xcode console`.

## Cortex API for Mobile
Although [Cortex API documentation](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/) is only for desktop, you can base on that to develop on Android since most of APIs are the same, except for these below APIs:

APIs | Desktop version | Mobile version
--------|--------|--------
[controlDevice](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/headset/controldevice)|available values for `command` parameter: "connect", "disconnect", "refresh".|available values for `command` parameter: "refresh". <br>*You can only connect or disconnect headsets via EMOTIV App*.
[queryHeadsets](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/headset/queryheadsets)|return all discovered headsets.|return one and only connected headset.
[exportRecords](https://emotiv.gitbook.io/cortex-api/records/exportrecord)|Supported.|Not supported.


## Cortex security certificates

### Android
Your app must configure a custom Certificate Authorities (CA) to trust Cortex websocket connection. See [Network security configuration on Android](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config). You can also look into `cortexclient` module for example:

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

    <application
        ...
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
        ...
    </application>

In `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:

    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="@raw/emotivca"/>
        <certificates src="system"/>
    </trust-anchors>

You should configure the same on your Android app.

### iOS

When open EMOTIV App, it will require you download and install Cortex's certificate. Please follow the instruction in the app and install the certificate correctly.
If you ignore this step example code will not work with Cortex API.
